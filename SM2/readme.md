#Savings Multiplied Part 2 Instructions

###Part 2
Task 1: Your first task is to recreate the views you made in part 1 using Bootstrap. If you take advantage of Bootstrap's grid system and nav bar a lot of the CSS you used in part1 will no longer be needed.

Task 2: Create an API call to the following address:
https://savingsmultipliedssh.firebaseio.com/items.json

This should return an array with 22 objects in it.  Each of those objects has an image url, username, price, title, and date open until.  Using this input and the mockup you did in part 1, you should have an auction page with items getting loaded in from the API.


Technologies you should use:

1. Bootstrap
2. jQuery
